#### `fib.coff`
This program prompts the first 2 numbers `f(1)` and `f(2)` of a Fibonacci sequence and an `n`, and compute the `f(n)`, 
the `n`th Fibonacci number. `n` can be as large as the max of unsigned int and will still give reasonable runtime, but 
too large of a number can't be stored in `int`.

The Fibonacci sequence up to the 8th number is `1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21`
